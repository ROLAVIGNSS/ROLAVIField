This repository hosts the public Privacy Policy for the **ROLAVIField** mobile application by **ROLAVI GNSS S.A.C. (Peru)**.

## How to publish via GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., `rolavifield-privacy`).

3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
   - **Source**: *Deploy from a branch*
